# FroyoFeedback
A full stack node application to get feedback about customers favorite flavors of frozen yogurt.

The customer will login to fill out their profile of favorite flavors. The customer will have the option to be notified via email when their favorite flavor is available and/or when their favorite flavor will be rotated out soon. They will also have the option to enter in their birthday month to receive a coupon via email.

The owner will be able to log in and see the data from all of the customer profile of flavors. There will be graphs to give a good visual with all of the numbers.
